Time Tracker Extension

Team Members:
1.) Dev Goel (B20CS090)
2.) Ravi Ramavat (B20CS053)

Problem Statement:
- We require a google chrome extension to allow the users to track their
daily time spend on each website they visit. There should be a way to
add/edit restrictions on websites, set ignore list of domains, set
notification time on websites and also it should store the users’ time
spent on each website so as to present the analytics in form of charts
and tabular data to the user.

Project Scenarios:
● Web analytics: This is the main use case/user scenario of our project, the
user will be provided with his web analytics of ‘all days’ activity, ‘last week’
activity and ‘today’ activity. The user will also be able to see a pie chart of
his activities, it will also be shown in the tabular form if he wants to see the
number of visits, time spent per website etc.
● Settings and customization: This scenario includes set theme, set
notifications, set restriction limits, set ignore list etc. options.
